account2@yahoo.com,passw0rd2,241.60.85.54:9999

### Performing Actions step:
You could perform one or multiple actions at once,
for performing one action, just enter its number from the list above (at console) then hit enter.
for multiple actions insert number of actions separated with a space, then hit enter (eg: 1 5 2).

Then Enjoy :D
